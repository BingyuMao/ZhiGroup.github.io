Our group is interested in using big data to advance percision medicine and health. 

Two main directions we are currently most excited about are:

* Analysis of big genotyped cohorts

Modern biobanks include genotypes up to 0.1%-1% of an entire large population. At this scale, genetic relatedness among samples is unavoidably ubiquitous. However, current methods are not efficient for uncovering genetic relatedness at such a scale. We developed a method, RaPID[https://github.com/ZhiGroup/RaPID], for detecting Identical-by-Descent (IBD) segments, a primary embodiment of genetic relatedness. RaPID detected all IBD segments over a certain length in time linear to the sample size. With simulation, we showed that RaPID is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, while offering higher power, accuracy, and sharper IBD segment boundaries. 

* Analysis of electronic health record (EHR) using deep learning

We have access to multiple EHR databases with over 50 Million patients. We develop deep learning methods for uncovering the logic of medical practice and to help improve efficiency of clincial care. One recent project is about predicting onset risk of heart failure from EHR.
